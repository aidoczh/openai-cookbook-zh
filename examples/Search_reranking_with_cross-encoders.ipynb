Unless situated in sufficiently (re)ionised regions, Lyman-α emission from these galaxies would be strongly absorbed by neutral gas in the intergalactic medium (IGM). We conservatively estimate sizes of the ionised regions required to reconcile the relatively low Lyman-α velocity offsets (ΔvLyα<300kms−1) with moderately high Lyman-α escape fractions (fesc,Lyα>5%) observed in our sample of LAEs, indicating the presence of ionised ``bubbles'' with physical sizes of the order of 0.1pMpc≲Rion≲1pMpc in a patchy reionisation scenario where the bubbles are embedded in a fully neutral IGM. Around half of the LAEs in our sample are found to coincide with large-scale galaxy overdensities seen in FRESCO at z∼5.8-5.9 and z∼7.3, suggesting Lyman-α transmission is strongly enhanced in such overdense regions, and underlining the importance of LAEs as tracers of the first large-scale ionised bubbles. Considering only spectroscopically confirmed galaxies, we find our sample of UV-faint LAEs (MUV≳−20mag) and their direct neighbours are generally not able to produce the required ionised regions based on the Lyman-α transmission properties, suggesting lower-luminosity sources likely play an important role in carving out these bubbles.

The reliance of\\nour framework on unpaired non-linguistic data makes it language-agnostic,\\nenabling it to be widely applicable beyond English NLP. Experiments on 7\\nsemantic textual similarity benchmarks reveal that models trained with the\\nadditional non-linguistic (/images/audio) contrastive objective lead to higher\\nquality sentence embeddings. This indicates that Transformer models are able to\\ngeneralize better by doing a similar task (i.e., clustering) with unpaired\\nexamples from different modalities in a multi-task fashion.',\n", "  'No',\n", "  -0.013869206)]"]}, "execution_count": 11, "metadata": {}, "output_type": "execute_result"}], "source": ["output_list[:10]"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 12, "id": "29a4dc08", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"data": {"text/html": ["<div>\n", "<style scoped>\n", "    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n", "        vertical-align: middle;\n", "    }\n", "\n", "    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n", "        vertical-align: top;\n", "    }\n", "\n", "    .dataframe thead th {\n", "        text-align: right;\n", "    }\n", "</style>\n", "<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n", "  <thead>\n", "    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n", "      <th></th>\n", "      <th>index</th>\n", "      <th>query</th>\n", "      <th>document</th>\n", "      <th>prediction</th>\n", "      <th>logprobs</th>\n", "      <th>probability</th>\n", "      <th>yes_probability</th>\n", "    </tr>\n", "  </thead>\n", "  <tbody>\n", "    <tr>\n", "      <th>0</th>\n", "      <td>0</td>\n", "      <td>how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings</td>\n", "      <td>SBERT studies Meaning Representations: Decompo...</td>\n", "      <td>Yes</td>\n", "      <td>-0.053264</td>\n", "      <td>0.948130</td>\n", "      <td>0.948130</td>\n", "    </tr>\n", "    <tr>\n", "      <th>1</th>\n", "      <td>1</td>\n", "      <td>how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings</td>\n", "      <td>Are Classes Clusters?: Sentence embedding mode...</td>\n", "      <td>No</td>\n", "      <td>-0.009535</td>\n", "      <td>0.990510</td>\n", "      <td>0.009490</td>\n", "    </tr>\n", "    <tr>\n", "      <th>2</th>\n", "      <td>2</td>\n", "      <td>how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings</td>\n", "      <td>Semantic Composition in Visually Grounded Lang...</td>\n", "      <td>No</td>\n", "      <td>-0.008887</td>\n", "      <td>0.991152</td>\n", "      <td>0.008848</td>\n", "    </tr>\n", "    <tr>\n", "      <th>3</th>\n", "      <td>3</td>\n", "      <td>how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings</td>\n", "      <td>Evaluating the Construct Validity of Text Embe...</td>\n", "      <td>No</td>\n", "      <td>-0.008584</td>\n", "      <td>0.991453</td>\n", "      <td>0.008547</td>\n", "    </tr>\n", "    <tr>\n", "      <th>4</th>\n", "      <td>4</td>\n", "      <td>how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings</td>\n", "      <td>Learning Probabilistic Sentence Representation...</td>\n", "      <td>No</td>\n", "      <td>-0.011976</td>\n", "      <td>0.988096</td>\n", "      <td>0.011904</td>\n", "    </tr>\n", "  </tbody>\n", "</table>\n", "</div>"], "text/plain": ["   index                                            query  \\\n", "0      0  how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings   \n", "1      1  how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings   \n", "2      2  how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings   \n", "3      3  how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings   \n", "4      4  how do bi-encoders work for sentence embeddings   \n", "\n", "                                            document prediction  logprobs  \\\n", "0  SBERT studies Meaning Representations: Decompo...
